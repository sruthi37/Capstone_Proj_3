## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT


## PROJECT : NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM



## **ðŸŽ¯ Overall Project Objective**


### Primary Objective

To design and implement a **complete Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** that can **automatically detect cyber attacks** in real-time network traffic using **Machine Learning**.

---

## What Problem We Solved?

### Before Project

- Network administrators had to **manually monitor** traffic
- **Slow threat detection** - attacks might be noticed hours/days later
- **Human error** in identifying sophisticated attacks
- **No automated classification** of normal vs malicious traffic

### After Project

- **24/7 automated monitoring**
- **Real-time attack detection** (within seconds)
- **Machine Learning accuracy** (~99.5%)
- **Instant alerts** for security teams
- **Beautiful dashboard** for visualization

---

## Real-World Applications

### Who Would Use This System?

1. **Network Security Teams** - Monitor corporate networks
2. **SOC Analysts** - Security Operations Center monitoring
3. **Small Businesses** - Affordable security monitoring
4. **Educational Institutions** - Campus network protection
5. **Cybersecurity Students** - Learning tool

### Types of Attacks It Detects

- **DDoS Attacks** - Flooding networks with traffic
- **Port Scanning** - Hackers searching for vulnerabilities
- **Brute Force Attacks** - Password guessing attempts
- **Malware Communication** - Infected computers "phoning home"
- **Suspicious Behavior** - Unusual network patterns
